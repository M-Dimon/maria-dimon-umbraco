                    <h3>A review on the movie Jojo Rabbit.</h3>
                    <p>
                        The movie revolves around our young protagonist, Jonathan Betzler, also known as Jojo Rabbit, a 10-year-old boy, living
                        with his single mother Rosie in Second world war Germany. <br><br>
                        
                        Jojo is a fanatic believer in Hitler's ideals, morals, and propaganda, and thus when he encountered the Jew girl, Elsa,
                        living within his walls, his life gets turned upside down. Faced with an intriguing inner conflict, Jojo battles against
                        what he has been made to believe and what he truly believes, or comes to believe. <br><br>
                        
                        During the movie, Jojo gets accompanied by his imaginary "friend" Adolf, Jojo's own personal Hitler on the go, with whom
                        he discusses and briefs his worries and conflicts. However, having this imaginary Adolf by his side is not always
                        helpful, as they as the movie progresses grow further and further from one another, in tandem. <br><br>
                        
                        At the end of the movie, the young Jojo Rabbit, finds himself a new man, complete with his own, beliefs, morals, and
                        ideals, having abandoned the teachings of Nazi Germany, for the Westerns.
                    </p>    
                    <h3>What is the movie about:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The movie in itself can have many meanings and the morale might always be perceived the same. In my opinion, the movie
                        is about shedding the ideals of others to create your own, forming your understanding rather than taking that of others
                        as your own. In this case, it starts with him building his understanding of Jews, by getting to know Elsa. <br><br>
                        
                        However, it can also be seen as a coming of age movie, and thus a movie simply about the life of a boy on his way to
                        becoming a man, and the challenges he faces along the way.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Overall:</h3>
                    <p>
                        I found the movie quite intriguing, as it gave a different kind of insight into the german history, although in a joking and, at the start, slightly demeaning way. Normally I wouldn't have watched this kind of movie, as it does not fit my regular and favored genres, nor did the trailer of the movie, at the time it got released, excite me. <br><br>
                        
                        The story showcased many different lessor issues and conflicts as they naturally arose, creating a constant shift in the balance, making it so I had to keep on my toes to fully understand the story as the movie progressed. <br><br>
                        
                        I found the way it build-up to these conflicts and issues, interesting and different. It was so different from what I was used to, the way they set it all up; the shifts, the changes in scenery, the characters, and when we see them. It was like seeing and hearing about many different tales, that together created a bigger picture, every moment had a role to play in building the viewer's experience and understanding of the movie.
                    </p>
                    <h3>In short:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The movie was different but intriguing. It gave insight, in a way that had the perfect balance between being funny and serious. I liked it however, I have seen movies I liked better.
